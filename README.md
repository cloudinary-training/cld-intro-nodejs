3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Paste the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable into your `.env` file.

## Run Code: Test Credentials

Make sure to npm install the Node.js libraries. You will be using the `cloudinary` and the `dotenv` libraries.

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
node testCredentials.js
```
You should see your Cloud Name and API Key. PS- Keep your secret private!


### Run Code:
Example- run scripts from the root because all references to local assets are relative to the root.

In order to upload all of the assets associated with these code examples and assign the correct Public ID to each, run this file:
```bash
node upload.js
```
